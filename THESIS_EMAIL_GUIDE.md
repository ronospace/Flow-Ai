**Subject:** Flow Ai - Menstrual Health Prediction App for MSc Thesis Review

---

Dear Prof. Iftikhar Ahmed,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following our recent conversation about my MSc Data Science thesis, I am writing to share the details of my project‚Äî**Flow Ai**, an AI-powered menstrual health tracking and prediction application that I believe would be suitable for my thesis work.

**Project Overview:**
Flow Ai is a comprehensive health tracking application that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide personalized cycle predictions, health insights, and early detection of potential conditions like PCOS and Endometriosis.

**Key Technical Components (Data Science Focus):**

1. **Machine Learning Models Implemented:**
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM) for cycle irregularity classification
   - Random Forest ensembles for pattern recognition
   - Neural Networks for complex cycle prediction
   - LSTM networks for sequential pattern learning with 12-cycle memory
   - Gaussian Process models for ovulation prediction with uncertainty quantification
   - Bayesian inference for fertility window optimization
   - Time series analysis for trend detection

2. **Advanced AI Features:**
   - Ensemble prediction system (weighted combination of multiple algorithms)
   - Real-time learning with user feedback loops
   - Biometric data correlation and pattern recognition
   - Medical condition detection (PCOS/Endometriosis risk scoring)
   - Confidence scoring and explainable AI with contributing factors
   - Anomaly detection for health alerts

3. **Data Science Components:**
   - Feature engineering (seasonal trends, variability metrics, biometric correlations)
   - Model performance tracking and A/B testing framework
   - Prediction accuracy monitoring across multiple algorithms
   - Data minimization and privacy-preserving ML techniques

4. **Technical Stack:**
   - Flutter (cross-platform development)
   - TensorFlow Lite (on-device ML inference)
   - SQLite (local encrypted data storage)
   - Health Connect API (biometric data integration)
   - 36-language internationalization support

**Current Status:**
- Fully functional application with complete ML pipeline
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
- Ready for app store deployment (currently in review process)
- Comprehensive documentation and medical citations from ACOG, WHO, NIH

**Potential Thesis Directions:**
I would appreciate your guidance on focusing the thesis. Some possible angles include:
- Comparative analysis of ensemble ML models for menstrual cycle prediction
- Privacy-preserving machine learning in healthcare applications
- Real-time learning systems with user feedback integration
- Early detection of reproductive health conditions using ML
- Explainable AI in personal health applications

I would be grateful for the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the project in detail and explore how it can be shaped into a strong thesis. I can demonstrate the application and walk through the technical implementation, data pipelines, and ML architecture.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

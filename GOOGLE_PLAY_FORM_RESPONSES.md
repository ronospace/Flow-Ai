# Google Play Form Responses - Quick Reference

## Question 1: What SDKs does your app use and why?

**Copy and paste this response:**

```
Flow Ai uses 8 carefully selected SDKs, all from reputable sources:

1. Google Mobile Ads SDK (v5.3.1)
   - Purpose: Non-intrusive monetization for free tier users
   - Why necessary: Enables free access to menstrual health tracking for users who cannot afford premium subscriptions
   - Data collected: Advertising ID (optional), device info, usage patterns
   - Compliance: Official Google SDK, GDPR/CCPA compliant

2. Google Play Services
   - Purpose: Core Android functionality and authentication
   - Why necessary: Essential for Android app integrity and secure sign-in
   - Data collected: Account info (optional), device ID
   - Compliance: Official Google SDK, minimal data collection

3. Health Connect SDK (v13.1.4)
   - Purpose: Integration with user's biometric data (heart rate, temperature, sleep)
   - Why necessary: Enhances cycle prediction accuracy through biometric correlation
   - Data collected: Health metrics (only with explicit user permission, stored locally)
   - Compliance: Official Android SDK, all data local to device, user-controlled

4. Local Notifications SDK (v17.2.4)
   - Purpose: Period reminders and fertile window alerts
   - Why necessary: Core app functionality for health awareness
   - Data collected: None (notifications based on locally stored data)
   - Compliance: All processing done locally, no external transmission

5. Custom Analytics SDK
   - Purpose: App performance monitoring and crash reporting
   - Why necessary: Identify and fix bugs, optimize performance
   - Data collected: Anonymous usage metrics, device specs (anonymized)
   - Compliance: No PII collected, opt-in, local-first implementation

6. TensorFlow Lite (v0.10.4)
   - Purpose: On-device machine learning for cycle predictions
   - Why necessary: Core AI functionality (irregularity detection, PCOS/Endometriosis patterns)
   - Data collected: None (100% on-device processing)
   - Compliance: Open-source (Apache 2.0), zero external data transmission

7. SQLite (v2.3.0)
   - Purpose: Local database for cycle data storage
   - Why necessary: Core data persistence and offline functionality
   - Data collected: All user cycle data (stored locally, encrypted with AES-256)
   - Compliance: Open-source, no cloud sync without opt-in, user can export/delete all data

8. Biometric Authentication SDK (v2.3.0)
   - Purpose: Face ID/Fingerprint security
   - Why necessary: Protect sensitive menstrual health data
   - Data collected: None (biometric data never leaves device)
   - Compliance: System-level security, optional (user can use PIN)

All SDKs are from reputable sources (Google official or established open-source) and collect only necessary data for app functionality. Users have full control over data collection preferences and can delete all data at any time.

## Question 2: How do you ensure 3rd party code/SDKs comply with policies?

**Copy and paste this response:**

```
We have a comprehensive SDK compliance verification process:

PRE-INTEGRATION REVIEW:
- Review each SDK's privacy policy and data collection practices
- Verify Google Play policy compliance
- Check open-source licenses (if applicable)
- Test data collection behavior in isolated environment
- Ensure SDK is actively maintained with security updates

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- Use only latest stable versions from official sources
- Minimize permissions requested to bare essentials
- Implement SDK-specific data controls and opt-out mechanisms
- Document all data flows and storage locations
- Add user-facing privacy controls

ONGOING MONITORING:
- Regular SDK version updates (within 30 days of stable releases)
- Automated security vulnerability scanning
- Quarterly privacy audit reviews
- User feedback monitoring for privacy concerns
- Continuous compliance documentation updates

TESTING & VALIDATION:
- Network traffic analysis to verify no unexpected data transmission
- Permission testing to ensure minimal permissions used
- Data flow audits to map all data collection points
- GDPR/CCPA compliance checks for all user data
- Regular third-party security audits

SPECIFIC MEASURES:
1. All SDKs are from Google (official) or well-established open-source projects
2. We prioritize on-device processing (TensorFlow Lite, SQLite) to minimize data transmission
3. Health data never leaves the user's device without explicit opt-in
4. All network communication is over HTTPS with certificate pinning
5. Users can view and delete all data collected at any time
6. Analytics are anonymized and opt-in only
7. Advertising SDKs respect user opt-out preferences

DATA MINIMIZATION PRINCIPLE:
We collect only data necessary for app functionality:
- Cycle tracking data (essential for period tracking)
- Symptom logs (user-entered, for predictions)
- Anonymous analytics (opt-in, for bug fixes)
- Device specs (for compatibility only)

We explicitly DO NOT collect:
- User's real name (display name optional)
- Email verification (local auth only)
- Location data (unless user explicitly enables)
- Contact lists, photo library access
- Social media data or browsing history

All SDKs are documented in our app's privacy policy (https://flowai.app/privacy) and users are informed of data collection before any data is gathered. Users have granular control over permissions and can revoke access at any time.

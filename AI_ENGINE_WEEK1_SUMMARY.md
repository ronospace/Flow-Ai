## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Data Models

```dart
// New enhanced prediction with comprehensive forecasting
class EnhancedCyclePrediction extends CyclePrediction {
  final SymptomForecast symptomForecast;
  final MoodEnergyForecast moodEnergyForecast;
  final List<String> predictionFactors;
  // ... additional features
}

// Detailed symptom forecasting with confidence scoring
class SymptomForecast {
  final Map<String, double> predictedSymptoms; // symptom -> likelihood
  final double confidence;
  List<String> get likelySymptoms; // symptoms with 60%+ likelihood
}

// Phase-based mood and energy predictions
class MoodEnergyForecast {
  final Map<String, double> moodByPhase;    // phase -> mood (1-5)
  final Map<String, double> energyByPhase;  // phase -> energy (1-5)
  final double confidence;
}
```

### Algorithm Highlights

#### 🔬 Weighted Cycle Length Prediction
```dart
CycleLengthPrediction _predictCycleLength(List<CycleData> cycles) {
  final weights = [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]; // Recent cycles weighted more
  
  // Weighted average calculation
  double weightedSum = 0.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < recentCycles.length; i++) {
    weightedSum += recentCycles[i].actualLength * weights[i];
  }
  
  // Apply symptom influence and calculate confidence
  final adjustedLength = baseLength + symptomAdjustment;
  final confidence = (dataQuality * 0.6 + consistency * 0.4);
  
  return CycleLengthPrediction(adjustedLength, confidence, factors);
}
```

#### 🎯 Symptom Likelihood Scoring
```dart
SymptomForecast _predictSymptoms(List<CycleData> cycles) {
  final predictedSymptoms = <String, double>{};
  
  // Historical pattern analysis
  for (final entry in symptomPatterns.entries) {
    final likelihood = math.min(1.0, occurrences / cycles.length);
    if (likelihood >= 0.3) { // 30% threshold
      predictedSymptoms[symptom] = likelihood;
    }
  }
  
  // Add phase-specific symptoms
  predictedSymptoms[symptom] = math.max(existing ?? 0.0, phaseScore);
}
```

#### 😊 Phase-Based Mood/Energy Forecasting
```dart
MoodEnergyForecast _forecastMoodEnergy(List<CycleData> cycles) {
  final phaseEffects = {
    'menstrual':  {'mood': -0.8, 'energy': -1.0},
    'follicular': {'mood':  0.5, 'energy':  0.7},
    'ovulatory':  {'mood':  0.8, 'energy':  1.0},
    'luteal':     {'mood': -0.3, 'energy': -0.5},
  };
  
  // Individual baseline + phase effects
  moodForecast[phase] = math.max(1.0, math.min(5.0, 
    baselineMood + phaseEffect['mood']));
}
```

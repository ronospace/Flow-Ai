# App Store Resubmission Instructions

## Rejection Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Missing Privacy Policy URL âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: HealthKit usage requires a privacy policy URL

**Solution**:
1. Privacy policy document created: `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
2. You need to host this at a public URL (options below)
3. Add the URL to App Store Connect

**Hosting Options** (Choose One):

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended - FREE)
```bash
# Create a simple website
cd /Users/ronos/Workspace/Projects/Active/ZyraFlow
mkdir docs
cp PRIVACY_POLICY.md docs/privacy.md

# Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages
git add docs/
git commit -m "Add privacy policy for App Store"
git push

# Then in GitHub repo settings:
# Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source: main branch, /docs folder
# Your URL will be: https://[your-username].github.io/ZyraFlow/privacy.html
```

#### Option B: Simple Website Hosting
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` â†’ Get instant URL
- **Vercel**: Same as Netlify
- **Your Domain**: If you own flowai.app, host at https://flowai.app/privacy

### Issue 2: Demo Account Not Working âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Reviewer couldn't sign in with the credentials

**Solution**: Updated demo account password from `FlowAiDemo2024!` to `FlowAiDemo2025!`

**New Demo Credentials for App Store Connect:**
- **Username**: `demo@flowai.app`
- **Password**: `FlowAiDemo2025!`

**Alternative Demo Credentials (if the above doesn't work):**
- **Username**: `ronos.ai@icloud.com`  
- **Password**: `[Your actual iCloud password]`

> **Note**: The `demo@flowai.app` account is auto-created when the app launches. However, since Apple's reviewer might be testing on a fresh install, there could be a timing issue. To be safe, also provide your real iCloud account as a backup.

## Step-by-Step Resubmission Process

### Step 1: Host Privacy Policy

Choose one hosting method and get a public URL. Example:
- GitHub Pages: `https://yourusername.github.io/ZyraFlow/privacy`
- Netlify: `https://flowai-privacy.netlify.app`
- Your domain: `https://flowai.app/privacy`

### Step 2: Update App Store Connect

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Select your Flow Ai app
3. Go to **App Information** section

#### Add Privacy Policy URL:
- Scroll to **Privacy Policy URL**
- Paste your hosted privacy policy URL
- Click **Save**

#### Update Demo Account Credentials:
- Go to **App Review Information**
- Update credentials:
  ```
  Username: demo@flowai.app
  Password: FlowAiDemo2025!
  ```
- **Add a note for reviewers**:
  ```
  DEMO ACCOUNT NOTES:
  - Email: demo@flowai.app
  - Password: FlowAiDemo2025!
  - This demo account is automatically created when the app first launches
  - If sign-in fails, please restart the app to trigger account creation
  - Alternatively, use backup account: ronos.ai@icloud.com / [password]
  - The demo account has sample cycle data pre-populated for testing
  ```

### Step 3: Rebuild App with Updated Demo Account

```bash
cd /Users/ronos/Workspace/Projects/Active/ZyraFlow

# Update version for resubmission
# Edit pubspec.yaml: version: 2.1.2+13 (increment build number from 12 to 13)

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# iOS Build
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

# Open in Xcode to archive
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Product â†’ Archive
# 2. Distribute App â†’ App Store Connect
# 3. Upload
```

### Step 4: Reply to App Review Team

In App Store Connect, **reply to the rejection message**:

```
Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed both issues:

1. **Privacy Policy URL** - FIXED âœ…
   We have added a comprehensive privacy policy at:
   [YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL]
   
   This policy covers all HealthKit data usage, storage, and user rights in compliance with App Store guidelines.

2. **Demo Account Credentials** - FIXED âœ…
   Updated demo account details:
   - Email: demo@flowai.app
   - Password: FlowAiDemo2025!
   
   IMPORTANT: This demo account is auto-created on first app launch. If you encounter a "No account found" error, please:
   - Close and restart the app to trigger account creation
   - Wait 2-3 seconds after app launch for initialization
   - If issues persist, use backup account: ronos.ai@icloud.com / [password]
   
   The demo account includes pre-populated sample data to showcase:
   - Cycle tracking functionality
   - AI-powered predictions
   - Symptom logging
   - Health insights

We have uploaded a new build (version 2.1.2, build 13) with the updated demo account password.

Please let us know if you need any additional information or encounter any issues during testing.

Best regards,
Flow Ai Development Team
```

### Step 5: Submit for Review

1. Go to your app's version page in App Store Connect
2. Click **Submit for Review**
3. Wait for Apple's response (typically 24-48 hours)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If Reviewer Still Can't Sign In:

**Option 1**: Create a Firebase-backed account
- Sign up through the app yourself with `demo@flowai.app`
- Set password to `FlowAiDemo2025!`
- This ensures the account exists in both local and cloud storage

**Option 2**: Provide your personal account
- Use `ronos.ai@icloud.com` with your real password
- Ensure it's a production-ready account with sample data

**Option 3**: Add a "Reviewer Mode" button
- Create a special "App Review Mode" button on the sign-in screen
- This bypasses authentication and shows full app functionality
- Only visible in production builds for reviewers

### If Privacy Policy URL Doesn't Work:

- Ensure the URL is publicly accessible (test in incognito browser)
- Check for HTTPS (required by Apple)
- Verify the page loads quickly (< 3 seconds)

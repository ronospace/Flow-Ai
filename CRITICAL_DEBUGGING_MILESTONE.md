- Incorrect platform-specific package imports
- Blocking compilation of security features

**Solution**:
- Fixed imports in `security_manager.dart` and `security_privacy_service.dart`
- Removed incorrect `local_auth_android` and `local_auth_ios` package references
- Properly configured biometric authentication using standard `local_auth` package

**Impact**: ‚úÖ Security system now fully functional

### 2. **Performance Monitor Animation API** ‚ö° CRITICAL FIX
**Problem**:
- `disableAnimations` setter not available in current Flutter API
- Performance optimization breaking app compilation
- Deprecated API usage causing build failures

**Solution**:
- Updated `performance_monitor.dart` to use API-compliant optimization suggestions
- Replaced direct property assignment with conditional optimization logic
- Added proper fallback mechanisms for animation control

**Impact**: ‚úÖ Performance monitoring system stabilized

### 3. **Smart Notification Null Safety** ‚ö° CRITICAL FIX
**Problem**:
- Null pointer exceptions in smart notification initialization
- Missing null-aware operators on potentially nullable objects
- Runtime crashes during notification system startup

**Solution**:
- Enhanced null safety in `smart_notification_system.dart`
- Added proper null-aware operators (`?.`) with fallback futures
- Implemented safe initialization patterns for optional services

**Impact**: ‚úÖ Notification system now crash-resistant

### 4. **Consumer Intelligence Enum Sorting** ‚ö° CRITICAL FIX
**Problem**:
- Missing `compareTo` method on `RecommendationPriority` enum
- Sorting operations failing throughout the AI engine
- Consumer intelligence features non-functional

**Solution**:
- Added extension method with `compareTo` implementation
- Enabled proper enum sorting by index
- Restored consumer intelligence engine functionality

**Impact**: ‚úÖ AI recommendation system operational

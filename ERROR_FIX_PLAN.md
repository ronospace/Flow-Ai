   - Need to use copyWith pattern or proper constructors
   - **File**: expert_qa_service.dart

3. **Gamification Module** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Missing widget files being imported
   - **File**: gamification_dashboard_screen.dart
   - **Action**: Remove imports or create stub widgets

4. **Healthcare Service** (HIGH PRIORITY)

## Strategy: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Comment Out Non-Essential Features (QUICK WIN)
Since many features are still in development, we can comment out:
- Community module (not yet in production)
- Gamification module (not yet in production)
- Expert Q&A (not yet in production)

This will reduce errors by ~40% immediately.

### Phase 2: Fix Core Features (ESSENTIAL)
- Premium subscription system âœ… (DONE)
- Cycle tracking
- AI predictions
- Health insights
- Notifications

### Phase 3: Fix Models and Types
- Add missing model methods
- Fix type conflicts
- Add missing constructors

### Phase 4: Clean Build
- Run flutter analyze
- Fix remaining lint warnings
- Test build

## Recommendation: Fast Track to Working Build

Given the scope of errors, I recommend:

1. **Comment out experimental features** (Community, Gamification, Expert Q&A)
   - These are not critical for MVP
   - Can be re-enabled later when fully implemented

2. **Focus on core features** that are working:
   - âœ… Premium subscription system
   - âœ… Onboarding
   - Cycle tracking (needs fixes)
   - AI predictions (needs fixes)
   - Health insights (needs fixes)

3. **Target: Clean build in 30 minutes**
   - Comment out broken modules: 10 min
   - Fix core models: 10 min
   - Fix type conflicts: 5 min
   - Test build: 5 min

## Decision Point

**Do you want me to:**

**Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended for now)**
- Comment out non-essential features
- Fix only core functionality
- Get to clean build fast
- Re-enable features incrementally

**Option B: Comprehensive Fix**
- Fix all 1240 issues systematically
- Will take 2-3 hours
- Higher risk of introducing new issues
- Everything working but slower

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Comment out Community/Gamification/ExpertQA
- Fix all core features properly
- Target 30-45 minute timeline
- Most balanced approach

I recommend **Option C (Hybrid)** - this gets us to a clean, working build with all premium features functional, while deferring the experimental features for later.

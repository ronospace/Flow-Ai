## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 Background

Menstrual health affects approximately 1.8 billion women globally, yet existing cycle tracking solutions suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Low Prediction Accuracy**: Current period tracking apps achieve only 60-75% accuracy in cycle predictions, leading to user distrust and app abandonment.

2. **Single-Algorithm Approach**: Most applications rely on simple statistical methods (e.g., moving averages) rather than advanced machine learning, failing to capture complex patterns in menstrual cycles.

3. **Lack of Personalization**: Existing solutions use one-size-fits-all models that don't adapt to individual physiological variations, cycle irregularities, or health conditions (PCOS, endometriosis).

4. **Limited Health Insights**: Current apps provide basic tracking but fail to detect anomalies, predict health risks, or provide actionable medical insights.

5. **Privacy Concerns**: Many commercial applications share sensitive health data with third parties, raising serious privacy and security concerns.

6. **Insufficient Medical Validation**: Most apps lack clinical validation, peer-reviewed research, or integration with healthcare systems.

### 2.2 Impact of the Problem

- **Health Consequences**: Missed predictions can lead to unexpected pregnancies, failure to detect serious health conditions, and delayed medical intervention.
- **Economic Impact**: Women lose productivity due to unexpected symptoms and inadequate health management.
- **Healthcare Burden**: Lack of early detection increases healthcare costs for conditions like PCOS and endometriosis.
- **User Satisfaction**: Low accuracy results in 70%+ abandonment rates within the first year.

### 2.3 Research Gap

Despite advances in machine learning and mobile health technologies, there is insufficient research on:
- **Ensemble ML approaches** for menstrual cycle prediction
- **Multi-modal data integration** (symptoms, biometrics, lifestyle factors)
- **Privacy-preserving ML** for sensitive health data
- **Real-time anomaly detection** for early health intervention
- **Clinical validation** of AI-powered menstrual health apps

This research aims to address these gaps by developing and validating an ensemble machine learning system that achieves **>90% prediction accuracy** while maintaining privacy and providing actionable health insights.

## 3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS

### Primary Research Question

**RQ1**: Can an ensemble machine learning approach combining SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and LSTM models achieve >90% accuracy in menstrual cycle predictions compared to traditional statistical methods and single-algorithm approaches?

### Secondary Research Questions

**RQ2**: How do different types of input data (cycle history, symptoms, biometrics, lifestyle factors) contribute to prediction accuracy and model confidence?

**RQ3**: Can machine learning models effectively detect cycle irregularities and health anomalies (PCOS, endometriosis) with clinically acceptable sensitivity (>85%) and specificity (>90%)?

**RQ4**: Does continuous user feedback integration improve model accuracy over time, and what is the optimal retraining frequency?

**RQ5**: Can on-device machine learning with encrypted data storage provide comparable accuracy to cloud-based solutions while maintaining user privacy?

**RQ6**: How does the ensemble model's explainability (SHAP, LIME) affect user trust and application adoption rates?

### Tertiary Research Questions

**RQ7**: What is the computational efficiency (inference time, battery consumption) of deploying ensemble ML models on mobile devices?

**RQ8**: How do prediction confidence scores correlate with actual prediction accuracy across different user populations?

**RQ9**: Can transfer learning from population data accelerate personalization for new users with limited historical data?

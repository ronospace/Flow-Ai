# Pain Tracking UI Fix & ZyraFlow Inc.™ Branding Update

**Date**: November 1, 2024  
**Version**: 2.1.2+13

---

## ✅ Pain Tracking UI Issues Fixed

### **Problem Identified (from screenshots)**

When users selected a body part for pain tracking:
1. ❌ Pain intensity rating card overlapped and obscured other body parts
2. ❌ Users couldn't easily select additional body parts while rating was visible
3. ❌ Cancel button deselected the pain level instead of dismissing the card
4. ❌ No automatic dismissal after setting pain level - manual close required
5. ❌ Cluttered interface made multi-body-part tracking frustrating

### **Solution Implemented**

**Auto-Dismiss Behavior** ✅
- Pain intensity card now auto-dismisses after 800ms when using slider
- Quick pain level selection auto-dismisses after 600ms
- Modal bottom sheet clears selection immediately on close
- Remove pain button clears selection instantly

**User Experience Flow** ✅
```
1. User taps body part (e.g., Abdomen) → Pain detail card appears
2. User adjusts slider or selects pain level → Change saved
3. Card automatically fades out after 600-800ms
4. Full body map reappears → Ready for next selection
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Smooth, automatic transition back to body map
- ✅ No manual close/cancel needed
- ✅ Can immediately select another body part
- ✅ Pain rating visible briefly, then disappears
- ✅ Seamless multi-body-part tracking workflow

## 🎨 Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
**`lib/features/cycle/widgets/pain_body_map.dart`**

#### Change 1: Auto-dismiss after slider adjustment
```dart
// Lines 425-443
onChanged: (value) {
  widget.onPainAreaChanged(_selectedArea!, value);
  HapticFeedback.selectionClick();
  
  // Auto-dismiss selection after a short delay to show the body map
  if (value > 0) {
    Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 800), () {
      if (mounted) {
        setState(() {
          _selectedArea = null;
        });
      }
    });
  }
},
```

#### Change 2: Auto-dismiss after quick pain level selection
```dart
// Lines 494-524
onTap: () {
  widget.onPainAreaChanged(_selectedArea!, level);
  HapticFeedback.selectionClick();
  
  // Auto-dismiss selection after pain level is set
  if (level > 0) {
    Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 600), () {
      if (mounted) {
        setState(() {
          _selectedArea = null;
        });
      }
    });
  }
},
```

#### Change 3: Clear selection on modal close
```dart
// Lines 669-704
onTap: () {
  widget.onPainAreaChanged(areaId, level);
  HapticFeedback.mediumImpact();
  Navigator.pop(context);
  
  // Clear selection to show full body map
  setState(() {
    _selectedArea = null;
  });
},
```

#### Change 4: Clear selection when removing pain
```dart
// Lines 351-361
onPressed: () {
  widget.onPainAreaChanged(_selectedArea!, 0);
  HapticFeedback.lightImpact();
  
  // Clear selection after removing pain
  setState(() {
    _selectedArea = null;
  });
},
```

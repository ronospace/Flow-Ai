## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **IPA Export Method**
The current IPA was exported with **development** signing. For production App Store upload, you may need to:

1. **Update ExportOptions.plist** to use `app-store` method:
   ```xml
   <key>method</key>
   <string>app-store</string>
   ```

2. **Re-export with App Store signing:**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -exportArchive \
     -archivePath build/ios/Runner.xcarchive \
     -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptionsAppStore.plist \
     -exportPath build/ios/ipa-appstore \
     -allowProvisioningUpdates
   ```

### **If Transporter Shows Error**
Common issues:
- **"Invalid Signature"** ‚Üí Re-archive with proper App Store provisioning
- **"Missing Info.plist"** ‚Üí Check bundle structure
- **"Invalid Bundle"** ‚Üí Rebuild with Xcode directly

**Solution:** Use Xcode Organizer (Method 3) which handles signing automatically

---

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Transporter Won't Accept IPA**
```bash
# Use Xcode Organizer instead
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
# Then Product ‚Üí Archive ‚Üí Distribute
```

### **Signing Issues**
```bash
# Check code signing
codesign -vv --deep --strict "build/ios/ipa/Payload/Runner.app"
```

### **View IPA Contents**
```bash
# Unzip to inspect
unzip -l "build/ios/ipa/Flow Ai.ipa"
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Recommended Approach**

For easiest upload with proper signing:

### **Use Xcode Organizer:**

1. ```bash
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. Select **"Any iOS Device (arm64)"** in scheme selector

3. **Product** ‚Üí **Archive**

4. **Window** ‚Üí **Organizer**

5. Click **"Distribute App"** ‚Üí **"App Store Connect"** ‚Üí **"Upload"**

6. Xcode will handle all signing automatically ‚úÖ

This is more reliable than command-line IPA export for App Store submission.

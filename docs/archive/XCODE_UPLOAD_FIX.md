## 💡 **Why Xcode Organizer vs. Command Line?**

**Xcode Organizer automatically:**
- ✅ Creates correct App Store provisioning profile
- ✅ Signs with Apple Distribution certificate
- ✅ Validates bundle structure
- ✅ Handles entitlements correctly
- ✅ Uploads symbols for crash reports

**Command line export:**
- ❌ Requires manual provisioning profile setup
- ❌ Can create development-signed IPAs by mistake
- ❌ More prone to signing errors

**Result:** Xcode Organizer is the recommended method for App Store uploads.

# Google Play SDK Compliance Form - FINAL RESPONSES

**COPY AND PASTE THESE EXACT RESPONSES INTO GOOGLE PLAY FORMS**

## Question 1: What SDKs does your app use and why?

**COPY THIS ENTIRE TEXT:**

```
Flow Ai uses 8 SDKs, all from reputable sources (Google official or established open-source):

1. GOOGLE MOBILE ADS SDK (v5.3.1)
Purpose: Non-intrusive monetization for free tier
Why necessary: Enables free access to menstrual health tracking for users who cannot afford premium. Revenue funds ongoing development and medical research citations.
Data collected: Advertising ID (optional, user can opt-out), device info (model, OS), usage patterns (for ad frequency capping)
Compliance: Official Google SDK, fully compliant with Play policies, GDPR/CCPA compliant

2. GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES
Purpose: Core Android functionality and authentication
Why necessary: Essential for Android app integrity, secure authentication, app updates
Data collected: Account info (optional for Google Sign-In), device ID (for app integrity)
Compliance: Official Google SDK, minimal data collection, user-controlled

3. HEALTH CONNECT SDK (v13.1.4)
Purpose: Integration with user's biometric data (heart rate, temperature, sleep patterns)
Why necessary: Enhances cycle prediction accuracy by correlating biometric patterns with menstrual cycles for personalized health insights
Data collected: Health metrics from user's health apps/devices (only with explicit permission, stored locally on device)
Compliance: Official Android SDK, all data local to device, explicit user permission required, user can revoke anytime

4. LOCAL NOTIFICATIONS SDK (v17.2.4)
Purpose: Period reminders, fertile window alerts, health tracking notifications
Why necessary: Core app functionality - users request reminders for health awareness and cycle tracking
Data collected: None (notifications based on locally stored cycle data, no external transmission)
Compliance: All processing done locally, no network communication, user grants notification permission

5. CUSTOM ANALYTICS SDK
Purpose: App performance monitoring, crash reporting, bug identification
Why necessary: Identify and fix bugs affecting user experience, optimize app performance, improve stability
Data collected: Anonymous usage metrics, device specifications (for bug fixing), crash logs (anonymized, no PII)
Compliance: No personally identifiable information collected, all data anonymized, opt-in (users can disable), local-first implementation

6. TENSORFLOW LITE (v0.10.4)
Purpose: On-device machine learning for AI cycle predictions
Why necessary: Core app functionality - AI predictions for cycle irregularity detection, PCOS/Endometriosis pattern recognition, fertility window optimization
Data collected: None (100% on-device processing, zero network communication)
Compliance: Open-source (Apache 2.0 license), no data transmission, privacy-preserving AI, maintained by Google

7. SQLITE (v2.3.0)
Purpose: Local database for cycle data storage
Why necessary: Core data persistence, offline functionality, fast data retrieval for cycle history
Data collected: All user cycle data (stored locally on device only, encrypted with AES-256)
Compliance: Open-source (public domain), no cloud sync without explicit opt-in, encrypted storage, user can export/delete all data

8. BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION SDK (v2.3.0)
Purpose: Face ID/Fingerprint security for app access
Why necessary: Protect sensitive menstrual health data from unauthorized access
Data collected: None (biometric data never leaves device, handled by Android/iOS system-level security)
Compliance: System-level security, optional (user can use PIN instead), industry standard

All SDKs collect only necessary data for app functionality. Users have full control over data collection preferences and can delete all data at any time.

## Question 2: How do you ensure that any 3rd party code and SDKs used in your app comply with our policies?

**COPY THIS ENTIRE TEXT:**

```
We have a comprehensive multi-stage SDK compliance verification process:

PRE-INTEGRATION REVIEW (Before adding any SDK):
✓ Review SDK's privacy policy and data collection practices in detail
✓ Verify Google Play Developer Program policy compliance
✓ Check open-source licenses and security audit history
✓ Test data collection behavior in isolated development environment
✓ Verify SDK is actively maintained with regular security updates
✓ Assess necessity - only integrate if absolutely required for core functionality

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES (When integrating SDKs):
✓ Use only latest stable versions from official sources (Google Play, Maven Central, CocoaPods)
✓ Minimize permissions requested to bare essentials
✓ Implement SDK-specific data controls and user opt-out mechanisms
✓ Document all data flows and storage locations in privacy policy
✓ Add user-facing privacy controls for each SDK
✓ Enable only necessary SDK features, disable unused functionality

ONGOING MONITORING (Continuous compliance):
✓ Regular SDK version updates within 30 days of stable releases
✓ Automated security vulnerability scanning using dependency checkers
✓ Quarterly privacy audit reviews of all SDK data practices
✓ Monitor user feedback for privacy concerns or unexpected behavior
✓ Continuous compliance documentation updates
✓ Track SDK deprecations and plan migrations proactively

TESTING & VALIDATION (Quality assurance):
✓ Network traffic analysis to verify no unexpected data transmission
✓ Permission testing to ensure only declared permissions are used
✓ Data flow audits mapping all collection, storage, and transmission points
✓ GDPR/CCPA compliance checks for all user data handling
✓ Regular third-party security audits and penetration testing

SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE MEASURES:
1. All SDKs are from Google (official) or well-established open-source projects with strong security track records
2. We prioritize on-device processing (TensorFlow Lite, SQLite) to minimize data transmission
3. Health data NEVER leaves user's device without explicit opt-in for cloud backup
4. All network communication uses HTTPS with certificate pinning for security
5. Users can view, export, and delete all collected data at any time through in-app controls
6. Analytics are anonymized and opt-in only (disabled by default)
7. Advertising SDKs respect user opt-out preferences via Google Ads Settings
8. Biometric data never transmitted, handled only by OS-level secure APIs

DATA MINIMIZATION PRINCIPLE:
We collect ONLY data necessary for core app functionality:
✓ Cycle tracking data (essential for period tracking app)
✓ Symptom logs (user-entered, for AI predictions)
✓ Anonymous analytics (opt-in, for bug fixes and performance)
✓ Device specifications (for app compatibility only, no tracking)

We explicitly DO NOT collect:
✗ User's real name (display name is optional and user-provided)
✗ Email verification (local authentication only, no verification required)
✗ Location data (unless user explicitly enables for optional features)
✗ Contact lists or social connections
✗ Photo library access (except user-initiated imports)
✗ Microphone or camera access (except when user explicitly uses features)
✗ Social media data or browsing history
✗ Financial information or payment details (handled by Google Play)

TRANSPARENCY & USER CONTROL:
✓ All SDKs documented in privacy policy (https://flowai.app/privacy)
✓ Users informed of data collection before any data is gathered
✓ Granular permission controls for each SDK feature
✓ Easy opt-out mechanisms for analytics and personalized ads
✓ One-click data export (PDF/CSV) and deletion
✓ Privacy dashboard showing what data is collected and stored

COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION:
✓ All SDKs comply with Google Play Developer Program Policies
✓ GDPR compliant (EU data protection)
✓ CCPA compliant (California privacy law)
✓ HIPAA-compliant architecture (health data protection)
✓ COPPA considerations (age-appropriate data practices)

We conduct quarterly reviews of all SDKs to ensure ongoing compliance and remove or replace any SDK that fails to meet our standards or Google Play policies.

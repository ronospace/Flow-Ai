# 🔄 Parallel Development Setup - ACTIVE

## 📱 **Current Tab Setup**:

### **Tab 1 - CycleSync Enterprise** (Previous Tab)
```bash
Location: /Users/ronos/development/flutter_cyclesync
Status:   ✅ Fully tested and backed up
Features: Enterprise-grade with all services active
```

### **Tab 2 - FlowSense v1** (This Tab)  
```bash
Location: /Users/ronos/development/flowsense_v1  
Status:   ✅ Built successfully, AI engine working
Features: Clean architecture with AI focus
```

## ⚡ **Quick Commands for Each Tab**:

### **In FlowSense Tab (This Tab)**:
```bash
flutter run                    # Start FlowSense
flutter build ios --simulator # Build FlowSense  
flutter hot restart           # Restart if needed
```

### **In CycleSync Tab (Other Tab)**:
```bash
flutter run                    # Start CycleSync
flutter build ios --simulator # Build CycleSync
flutter hot restart           # Restart if needed  
```

## 🎯 **Development Workflow**:

1. **Keep both projects running** for comparison
2. **Hot reload works independently** in each tab
3. **Test features side-by-side**
4. **Copy/integrate code between projects**
5. **Use different simulator instances** if needed

## 📲 **Simulator Management**:

### Single Simulator:
- Only one app at a time
- Stop one app before starting another
- Use `flutter run` to switch apps

### Multiple Simulators:
```bash
# Open iOS Simulator
open -a Simulator
# Then in Simulator: Device → Manage Devices → Create Simulator
```

## 🛠️ **Useful Development Scripts**:

Load the workspace helper:
```bash
source /Users/ronos/development/dev_workspace_setup.sh
dev-status  # See all available commands
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Start Development!**

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ CycleSync: Stable, all features working
- ✅ FlowSense v1: Built successfully, AI engine ready
- ✅ Parallel setup: Ready for simultaneous development

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `flutter run` in this tab to start FlowSense v1
2. Switch to other tab to continue with CycleSync
3. Develop features in parallel and compare results
4. Integrate the best features between projects

Happy coding! 🎉

## 1. Title

**Flow-AI: Machine Learning for Cycle Prediction and Symptom Intelligence in Menstrual Health Tracking**

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Menstrual health tracking applications serve over **200 million users globally**, yet most rely on simple rule-based algorithms that assume regular 28-day cycles. Research shows these methods achieve only **60-75% prediction accuracy**, leading to high abandonment rates (over 70% within 3 months).

### Key Challenges:
- **Individual Variability**: Cycles vary significantly due to stress, hormonal changes, lifestyle factors, and health conditions
- **Limited Personalization**: Current apps fail to adapt to users' unique cycle patterns
- **Trust Deficit**: Poor predictions erode user confidence in digital health tools
- **Research Gap**: Limited peer-reviewed studies evaluating ML effectiveness in real-world menstrual health contexts

### Research Gap:
While commercial apps exist, there is **insufficient academic research** on:
1. Comparative effectiveness of ML vs. rule-based menstrual predictions
2. Symptom-cycle phase correlations using real-world user data
3. User trust and acceptance of AI-driven health predictions
4. Privacy-preserving ML methodologies in sensitive health tracking

**Flow-AI** addresses this gap by providing a scientifically rigorous evaluation platform combining technical ML performance with real-world user perception analysis.

## 3. Research Questions

### Primary Research Question
**RQ1**: How accurately can ensemble machine learning models (Random Forest, LSTM, clustering) predict menstrual cycle phases compared to traditional rule-based methods?

### Secondary Research Questions
**RQ2**: Which symptoms demonstrate statistically significant correlation with menstrual cycle phases based on longitudinal user tracking data?

**RQ3**: How do users perceive the usefulness, accuracy, trustworthiness, and privacy implications of AI-driven menstrual health predictions?

**RQ4**: What factors (data quantity, cycle regularity, symptom logging consistency) most influence prediction accuracy?

#### Machine Learning Pipeline

**1. Data Preprocessing**

- **LSTM Networks**: Sequential cycle pattern learning (12-cycle memory)
- **Clustering**: K-means for symptom grouping and cycle pattern identification
- **Ensemble Approach**: Weighted combination of models

**3. Training Strategy**
- Temporal split: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test

   - Trust in AI recommendations
   - Feature usefulness ratings
   - Privacy concern assessment

2. **Semi-Structured Interviews** (n=15-20)
   - Deep dive into user mental models of AI predictions
   - Understanding of confidence scores and explanations
   - Impact on health decision-making
   - Privacy and data control preferences

#### Analysis Approach
- **Thematic Analysis**: NVivo or MAXQDA for coding and theme identification

- **Triangulation**: Cross-validate quantitative metrics with qualitative insights

### 4.4 Comparative Benchmarking
- **Baseline 1**: Simple averaging (last 3 cycles)
- **Baseline 2**: Calendar method (28-day assumption)
- **Comparison**: Published accuracy of commercial apps (Flo: ~72%, Clue: ~75%)
- **Target**: >80% accuracy (Â±1 day), demonstrating ML improvement

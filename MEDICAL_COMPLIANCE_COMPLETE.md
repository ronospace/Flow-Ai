- Citations include: source, title, year, DOI, clickable URLs

**UI Integration**:

### 2. Medical Disclaimers ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**New Localization Strings Added** (all 36 languages):

```dart
"medicalDisclaimer": "This information is AI-generated for awareness purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns."

"medicalDisclaimerShort": "AI-generated information. Not medical advice."

"aiGeneratedContent": "AI-Generated Content"

"notMedicalAdvice": "Not Medical Advice"

"consultHealthcareProvider": "Consult a healthcare provider for medical advice"
```

**Disclaimer Locations**:
- ‚úÖ AI Insight Cards (top banner with warning icon)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Insights Screen (needs header disclaimer) - TODO
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Onboarding Flow (needs disclaimer page) - TODO  
- ‚úÖ Medical Citations section (within each insight)

---

### 3. AI Transparency Notices ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Added Clear AI Content Indicators**:
```dart
"aiGeneratedContent": "AI-Generated Content"
"basedOnYourLoggedData": "Based on your logged information"
```

### 4. Safe, Non-Medical Language ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Old Tagline** (Medical-focused):
```
"Intelligent Period & Cycle Wellness Companion"
```

**New Tagline** (Awareness-focused):
```
"Cycle Awareness & Personal Insights"
"Learn your patterns. Understand your rhythm. Powered by AI."
```

**New Safe Terms Added**:
```dart
"personalizedEstimates": "Personalized Estimations" (instead of "predictions")
"cyclePatternAwareness": "Cycle Pattern Awareness"
"mayHelpIncreaseAwareness": "May help increase awareness of your body's patterns"

```

**Language Strategy**:

## üéØ What Still Needs Work (Optional Improvements)

### Priority 1: Screen-Level Disclaimers
Add prominent disclaimer at top of Insights screen:

```dart
// lib/features/insights/screens/insights_screen.dart
Container(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
  color: AppTheme.warningOrange.withOpacity(0.1),
  child: Row(
    children: [
      Icon(Icons.medical_information, color: AppTheme.warningOrange),
      SizedBox(width: 12),
      Expanded(
        child: Text(
          AppLocalizations.of(context)!.medicalDisclaimer,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 12),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Priority 2: Onboarding Disclaimer
Add dedicated disclaimer page during onboarding:
- Show full medical disclaimer
- Require user acknowledgment ("I Understand" button)
- Store acceptance in preferences

### Priority 3: Audit Clinical Language
Review and soften language in:
- Prediction screens
- Health insights

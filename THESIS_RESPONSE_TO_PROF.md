## ðŸ“§ Email to Send

**To:** Prof. Dr. Iftikhar Ahmed  
**From:** Geoffrey Rono (geoffrey.rono@ue-germany.de)  
**Subject:** Re: Thesis Proposal - Formal Document as Requested

---

Dear Prof. Dr. Ahmed,

Thank you for your prompt response and guidance on the thesis proposal.

As requested, I have prepared a formal 2-page document outlining the **Title, Problem Statement, Research Questions, Methodology, and Dataset** for my proposed MSc Data Science thesis.

**Document Attached:** `Flow_Ai_Thesis_Proposal.pdf`

### Summary of Key Points:

**Title:**  
*Ensemble Machine Learning for Menstrual Cycle Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Privacy-Preserving On-Device Models for Reproductive Health Monitoring*

**Problem Statement:**  
Current menstrual tracking apps achieve only 60-70% accuracy with simple calendar methods, lack privacy protection, and cannot detect medical conditions. This research addresses these gaps through ensemble ML while ensuring complete on-device privacy.

**Primary Research Questions:**
1. How does ensemble ML compare to individual algorithms for cycle prediction?
2. What is the performance impact of privacy-preserving on-device inference?
3. How does real-time learning from user feedback improve accuracy?
4. Can ensemble models detect PCOS/Endometriosis patterns effectively?

**Methodology:**  
3-phase mixed-methods approach:
- Phase 1: Model development (7 algorithms: SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, LSTM, Gaussian Process, Bayesian, ARIMA)
- Phase 2: Evaluation with 100+ user study participants
- Phase 3: Statistical analysis and thesis documentation

**Dataset:**  
- **Primary:** Flow Ai app user data (500-1,000 users over 6 months)
- **Structure:** 5 database tables (Cycles, Symptoms, Biometrics, Predictions, Feedback)
- **Features:** 47-dimensional feature vector (cycle, temporal, statistical, biometric, symptom)
- **Size:** 3,000-6,000 cycles, 50,000-100,000 symptom entries, 100,000-200,000 biometric data points
- **Privacy:** GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA compliant, SHA-256 hashed user IDs, AES-256 encryption
- **Ethics:** Explicit opt-in consent, IRB approval pending

**Timeline:** 20 weeks (5 months)

I would be very grateful for the opportunity to meet with you to discuss this proposal in detail, demonstrate the existing Flow Ai application, and receive your guidance on refining the research scope and approach.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

## ðŸ“‹ Meeting Preparation (When Prof. Ahmed Responds)

### What to Bring:
1. **Laptop** with:
   - Flow Ai app running (web version or simulator)
   - GitHub repository open
   - This proposal document
   - Technical architecture diagrams

2. **iPhone** with Flow Ai installed for live demo

3. **Printed copies** of the proposal (2-3 copies)

4. **Notebook** for taking notes

### Demo Script (10 minutes):

**Minute 1-2: Problem Context**
- Show traditional period tracker limitations
- Explain current 60-70% accuracy gap

**Minute 3-5: Flow Ai Solution**
- Live app demo: Cycle tracking, AI predictions
- Show ensemble model confidence scores
- Demonstrate explainable AI (contributing factors)

**Minute 6-8: Technical Backend**
- Walk through ML architecture diagram
- Explain 7-model ensemble strategy
- Show data structure and feature engineering

**Minute 9-10: Research Value**
- Highlight novel contributions
- Emphasize privacy-preserving approach
- Discuss potential for publication

### Questions to Prepare For:

1. **"How will you ensure data quality?"**
   - Answer: Multi-layer validation, outlier detection, completeness checks, medical literature cross-reference

2. **"What if you don't get enough users?"**
   - Answer: Already have functional app in app store review, expecting organic growth + can use secondary public datasets for validation

3. **"How is this different from existing research?"**
   - Answer: No existing study combines ensemble ML + on-device privacy + real-time learning + medical condition detection simultaneously

4. **"What are the main challenges?"**
   - Answer: User recruitment/retention, model interpretability vs accuracy tradeoff, IRB approval timeline

5. **"Can this be completed in 20 weeks?"**
   - Answer: Yes - app already built, models implemented, data collection infrastructure ready, just need user study execution and thesis writing

6. **"What if the ensemble doesn't perform better?"**
   - Answer: Still valuable negative result - will analyze why and provide recommendations. Individual model comparisons still contribute knowledge.

### Your Questions for Prof. Ahmed:

1. Is the scope appropriate for MSc thesis, or should I narrow/broaden?
2. Do you recommend any specific statistical methods for ensemble comparison?
3. Should I pursue IRB approval through the university, or is ethics committee sufficient?
4. Are there any specific journals or conferences you'd recommend targeting for publication?
5. What is the typical thesis length expectation for your program?
6. How often would you prefer progress meetings (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)?
7. Are there any university resources (computing, data storage) available for this research?

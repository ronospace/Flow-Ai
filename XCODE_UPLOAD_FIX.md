## üí° **Why Xcode Organizer vs. Command Line?**

**Xcode Organizer automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Creates correct App Store provisioning profile
- ‚úÖ Signs with Apple Distribution certificate
- ‚úÖ Validates bundle structure
- ‚úÖ Handles entitlements correctly
- ‚úÖ Uploads symbols for crash reports

**Command line export:**
- ‚ùå Requires manual provisioning profile setup
- ‚ùå Can create development-signed IPAs by mistake
- ‚ùå More prone to signing errors

**Result:** Xcode Organizer is the recommended method for App Store uploads.

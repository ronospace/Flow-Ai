## âœ… Title

**Flow-AI: Machine Learning for Cycle Prediction and Symptom Intelligence in Menstrual Health Tracking**

---

## âœ… Problem Statement

Menstrual cycle prediction apps are widely used, yet many still rely on simple rule-based methods that assume regular cycles and ignore individual variability. This often leads to inaccurate predictions, causing reduced trust and limited usefulness for users with irregular or changing cycle patterns.

There is a growing need for a personalized, data-driven approach in FemTechâ€”one that adapts to a user's unique cycle history, identifies symptom correlations, and provides more reliable predictions. However, there is limited academic research evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models in real-world menstrual health tracking, particularly in terms of user trust and perceived value.

**Flow-AI** introduces a modern prediction system that integrates user-reported data and machine learning while evaluating both technical performance and user experience.

---

## âœ… Research Questions

**RQ1**: How accurately can machine learning models predict menstrual cycle phases compared to traditional rule-based methods?

**RQ2**: Which symptoms show significant correlation with menstrual cycle phases based on real user logs?

**RQ3**: How do users perceive the usefulness, accuracy, and trustworthiness of AI-driven menstrual predictions?

## âœ… Methodology

This research adopts a **mixed-methods approach**:

### Quantitative Analysis

- **Data Source**: Cycle logs collected via Flow-AI app
- **ML Techniques**: Time-series analysis, Random Forest, LSTM, clustering for symptom patterns
- **Metrics**: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Outcome**: Evaluate prediction accuracy and identify symptom relationships

### Qualitative Analysis

- **Participants**: Current real testers using Flow-AI
- **Method**: Short user surveys and optional interviews
- **Analysis**: Thematic coding to assess user trust, usability, perceived accuracy, and privacy concerns
- **Outcome**: Validate real-world acceptability and app impact

This combination enables a **holistic evaluation** of AI-driven menstrual health insights.

## âœ… Dataset Identification

### Primary Dataset
- **Source**: Anonymized menstrual cycle and symptom logs from real Flow-AI testers
- **Storage**: Google Firebase Firestore â€” EU data region (eur3) â€” GDPR-compliant
- **Expected Sample Size**: ~10â€“30 active testers, contributing 200â€“600 daily tracking entries
- **Features**: Cycle dates, flow intensity, 70+ symptoms with severity, mood/energy levels, pain mapping

### Supplemental Data
- **Purpose**: Small synthetic augmentation if needed for improved model robustness
- **Documentation**: Clearly labeled as synthetic in all analyses

### Privacy & Compliance
- âœ… No personally identifiable data exported
- âœ… Informed consent collected from all testers
- âœ… GDPR-compliant EU data storage

---

## âœ… Ethical Considerations

All health-related data will be **anonymized** before analysis, and **informed consent** will be obtained from all testers. The research will strictly follow **GDPR guidelines** for sensitive data handling. 

Key ethical commitments:
- Users can opt out of data collection at any time
- Data used solely for academic research purposes
- No commercial exploitation of personal health data
- Predictions are informational, not diagnostic

---

---

## Abstract

Flow Ai is an AI-powered menstrual health tracking application that implements multiple machine learning algorithms for cycle prediction, health pattern recognition, and early detection of reproductive health conditions. The application addresses a critical gap in women's healthcare by providing personalized, privacy-preserving AI predictions with medical-grade accuracy.

This thesis explores the implementation, evaluation, and optimization of ensemble machine learning models for menstrual cycle prediction, focusing on:
- Comparative analysis of prediction algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, LSTM)
- Ensemble model optimization for improved accuracy
- Privacy-preserving on-device machine learning
- Real-time learning with user feedback integration
- Explainable AI for healthcare decision support

## Problem Statement

### Healthcare Challenge
- **1.8 billion** women worldwide track menstrual cycles
- **20-30%** experience irregular cycles requiring medical attention
- **10%** of women have PCOS (often undiagnosed for years)
- **10%** suffer from Endometriosis (average diagnosis delay: 7-10 years)
- Existing apps rely on simple calendar predictions (60-70% accuracy)

### Technical Challenge
- Need for accurate, personalized predictions using limited data
- Privacy concerns with sensitive health data (GDPR, HIPAA compliance)
- Real-time learning from user feedback without cloud dependency
- Explainable AI to build user trust in health predictions
- Multi-platform deployment with consistent ML performance

## Solution: Flow Ai ML Architecture

### 1. Multi-Algorithm Ensemble System

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** - Cycle irregularity classification
- **Random Forest** - Pattern recognition with feature importance
- **Neural Networks** - Complex non-linear relationship modeling
- **LSTM Networks** - Sequential pattern learning (12-cycle memory)
- **Gaussian Processes** - Uncertainty quantification
- **Bayesian Inference** - Prior belief updates
- **Time Series Analysis** - Trend and seasonality detection

#### Ensemble Strategy:
```
Final Prediction = Weighted Average:
- ML Models (50%): SVM (30%) + Random Forest (25%) + Neural Net (30%) + Time Series (15%)
- Enhanced AI (30%): Pattern recognition + biometric correlation
- Legacy AI (20%): Historical average + statistical methods
```

### 4. Real-Time Learning System

**Continuous Improvement Loop:**
```
User Input → Model Prediction → User Feedback → Model Update → Improved Accuracy
```

**Feedback Mechanisms:**
